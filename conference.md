# Conference

- bring together the doers and makers of open collaboration projects
- the world's first conference on open collaboration (aside from open source)?

## Existing Conferences

- [OpenSym](https://opensym.org/): Focused on Wikipedia, rather academic
- [Creative Commons Conference](https://summit.creativecommons.org/): Build community around creative commons
  - Perhaps we can integrate into this conference and organize events around CC projects/businesses?
