# Movement

- we need an open collaboration movement

## Naming
- What should it be called?
- Open Source (OS): Open software code
- Open Access (OA): Open research
- [Open Content (OC)](opencontent.org)
  - Project shut down in early 2000s and founder joined Creative Commons ([Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content_Project))

## Creative Commons
- the biggest open collaboration movement (aside from open source)
- solid, proven licenses (CC license family)
- already used by many organizations
- [Share Your Work](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) page lists a few websites for sharing CC projects. There is no webpage for CC projects.
- how do we integrate into Creative Commons?
